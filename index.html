<p style="color: rgb(15, 2, 4);font-family: fantasy;"> To the <i> LIGHT OF MY LIFE </i>I want to say thank you for being there during the darkest moments of my life. For helping me through the times I thought I‚Äôd never come back from.The moments when I gave up on myself and even on life,you always found a way to reach me, to remind me that there was still light ahead even when I couldn‚Äôt see it. You brought me back to life with your love and your patience. </p>
